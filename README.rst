Built with Django Boilerplate
=============================

This is a baseline for my Django projects, and so it makes some assumptions for
some of my personal preferences and directory structure.

You can use it yourself by running this command (if using Django 1.4+)::

    django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/liamcurry/django-boilerplate/zipball/master \
                                 --extensions py,rst,in,ini,conf,html \
                                 --name Makefile,config/celeryd \
                                 project_name

Quickstart
==========

As simple as::

    make build
